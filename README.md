# Training_Python
Creating a small NPC generator/interaction tool via console to learn Python
The purpose of the code is not to necessarily create a final project but to learn Python

## Quick-Start
* With Python installed and the PATH set up... run the following in the command line:
Python Sidequest.py
* Follow the text-based prompts
* There is no goal, just see what you can gather about the character you encountered
* Right now, you can ask the character their name and check their aggression level.
* Different aggression levels garner different responses--asking a character's name twice may upset them.

## Key Notes
* The code is not highly legible, as it is written by a beginner
* Code learning--not review--is the purpose of this project

## How to Use
* Upon running the program, you will immediately be etered into an Encounter with an NPC (Non-Player Character)
* The NPC will have stats generated for them upon starting the program, these stats affect behavior
* It is up to the player to use the console options to interact with the NPC as they wish
* Real-time instructions are given to the player via the console
* Currently, this game does not include any notable goal

## Further Development
* Implement chat-bot-esque dialects and interactions
* Provide additional behavioral changes from stats
* Allow player to react to NPC behaviors
* Provide a goal for any single NPC encounter (may be unachievable if the wrong path 
is taken)
