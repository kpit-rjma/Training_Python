# Training_Python
Creating a small NPC generator/interaction tool via console to learn Python
The purpose of the code is not to necessarily create a final project but to learn Python

## Key Notes
* The code is heavily documented for the benefit of the code reader
* Code review is the primary purpose of this project

## How to Use
* Upon running the program, you will immediately be etered into an Encounter with an NPC (Non-Player Character)
* The NPC will have stats generated for them upon starting the program, these stats affect behavior
* It is up to the player to use the console options to interact with the NPC as they wish
* Real-time instructions are given to the player via the console
* Currently, this game does not include any notable goal

## Further Development
* Implement chat-bot-esque dialects and interactions
* Provide additional behavioral changes from stats
* Allow player to react to NPC behaviors
* Provide a goal for any single NPC encounter (may be unachievable if the wrong path is taken)
